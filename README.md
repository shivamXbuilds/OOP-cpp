# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++, **GeeksforGeeks (GfG)**, and **Code Beauty** .

## Topics Covered

The repo will eventually include implementations for all major OOP concepts in C++:

- **Classes and Objects**  
- **Constructors and Destructors**  
- **Inheritance**  
  - Single Inheritance  
  - Multiple Inheritance  
  - Multilevel Inheritance  
  - Hierarchical Inheritance  
  - Hybrid Inheritance  
- **Polymorphism**  
  - Compile-time (Function Overloading, Operator Overloading)  
  - Runtime (Virtual Functions)  
- **Encapsulation and Access Specifiers**  
- **Abstraction and Pure Virtual Functions**  
- **Friend Functions and Friend Classes**  

## Structure

Each file will focus on a specific OOP concept, with **clean C++ code examples**:
